## The Theme
The theme **Keep it alive** was published on Saturday April 18th, 2020 at 3am CEST and lasted 72 hours. Some ideas came around to our minds, but finally we decided to make a game about [Miner's canary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_canary#Miner's_canary).

#### Miner's Canary
>Canaries were used as sentinel species for use in detecting carbon monoxide in coal mining from around 1913 when the idea was suggested by John Scott Haldane. Toxic gases such as carbon monoxide or asphyxiant gases such as methane in the mine would affect the bird before affecting the miners. Signs of distress from the bird indicated to the miners that conditions were unsafe. The birds were generally kept in carriers which had small oxygen bottles attached to revive the birds, so that they could be used multiple times within the mine. The use of miners' canaries in British mines was phased out in 1986.

## The Game

#### Tools
* Unity 2019.3.10
* sfxr
* Medibang Paint
* Photoshop

#### Platforms
* WebGL

#### GamePlay
You are a miner in a completely dark cave. Your only companion is a canary that will detect pockets of hazardous gas, and your task is to find the diamonds that this dangerous place contains, by mining the rocks beneath your feet. 

Take care, though, for inhaling too much gas can result in you or your canary fainting, and that will terminate your adventure. **KEEP IT ALIVE**

#### Controls
* A/D or Left/Right arrows to move the character.
* W, Up arrow or Space to jump.
* Left mouse button will make the character start mining a block, if there is any at range.
* Right mouse button will pick up or drop the canary. 

The canary will warn you when you are approaching a pocket of gas, but it will also inhale more oxygen than you, and therefore resist less exposition. Use at your own will, and please take care of it!
